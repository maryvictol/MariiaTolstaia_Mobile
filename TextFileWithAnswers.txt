5.	Modify existing tests to run on a real device. What should be changed?

    Capability DEVICE_NAME should be changed.

6.	Connect a real device to Appium (describe required actions) and run tests.
Are there any difference with run on emulator?
To test on a real Android device, leave your configuration as it was when you set up Appium to work with the emulator and proceed as follows:
    1. Connect your device to the server machine via USB.
	2. On devices, which are version 4.2 and higher, to enable “USB Debugging” follow these steps:
       - Settings > About Phone > Build number > Tap it 7 times to become developer
       - Settings > Developer Options > USB Debugging
	       Click ‘OK’ when the ‘Allow USB debugging’ pop-up shows up, after connecting the USB cable.
	3. Check field "Device Name"
	4. Close the Android emulator if it is still running
	
Real device faster than emulator
